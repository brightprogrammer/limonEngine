# LimonEngine

Limon is a multi platform 3D game engine mainly focusing on first person games. Focus of its development is ease of use and ease of study. 

## Feature Overview

- 3D rendering with dynamic lighting/shadows
- Rigid body physics
- 3D spatial sound
- Built-in editor with animation sequencer
- C++ API for extensibility, and dynamic loading of extensions

For details check out the [project web site](http://enginmanap.github.io/limonEngine/status.html)

Prebuilt binaries for Windows, Linux and MacOS can be [found here](https://github.com/enginmanap/limonEngine/releases)

Documentation is served on [readthedocs](https://limonengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Building from source on Ubuntu 18.10:

Step 1) Open Terminal, then copy and paste the following command
```bash
$ sudo apt install cmake git git-lfs libassimp-dev libbullet-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libfreetype6-dev libtinyxml2-dev libglew-dev build-essential libglm-dev
```
Step 2) Since GitHub is limiting LFS bandwidth, it is removed. Cloning the LimonEngine repository should also include all data needed:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/enginmanap/limonEngine.git && cd limonEngine
```
Step 3) Next, we need to navigate to the directory run cmake:
```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && cd ..
```
Step 4) Finally, we need to navigate to the build directory, make the source and copy the `Data` directory to the `build` directory:
```bash
$ cd build && make && cp -a ../Data .
```

## Running

### Start up: 
- Engine take a parameter as path of world to load
- If no parameter passed, falls back to `./Data/Maps/World001.xml`
```bash
$ ./LimonEngine ./Data/Maps/World001.xml
```

### In Application:
- Pressing `0` switches to debug mode, renders physics collision meshes and disconnects player from physics (flying and passing trough objects)
- Pressing `F2` key switches to editor mode, which allows creating maps.
- Pressing `+` and `-` changes mouse sensitivity.
- `wasd` for walking around and mouse for looking around as usual.

### In editor mode:
- Since static and dynamic objects rigidbodies are not generated by same logic, mass settings can't be changed after object creation.
- Inanimate objects are not allowed to have AI
- You can create animations for doors etc. in editor. For animation creation, time step is 60 for each second.
- When a new animation is created by animation editor, the object used to create the animation assumed to have this animation. You can remove by using the remove animation button.

### Extending with C++
- Limon Engine has 3 types of extensions:
    - Actions for triggers and buttons
    - AI for actors
    - Player for Input handling
- All uses the same API, but called upon depending on their type.
- Engine tries to load custom extensions from `libcustomTriggers.dll` for Windows, `libcustomTriggers.so` for GNU/Linux and `libcustomTriggers.dylib` for macOS. If you use an customisation in a map and library is missing, that customisation wont work, but rest of the map will.
